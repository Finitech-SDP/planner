# Autonomous Parking using PDDL

## To Run
```
./plan.sh
```

which uses `domain.pddl` and `problem.pddl` files in the current directory by default.

`plan.sh` uses Docker and might take a while during the download of Docker images at first run. Subsequent runs shall be quite fast (< 2s).

- Docker
- PDLL Planner
